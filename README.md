# Mischief

This respository hosts the binaries and code for Mischief for the purpose of reverse engineering and QOL modifications.

Mischief is a discontinued free drawing/sketching app based on Adaptively Sampled Distance Fields technology that allows a vector-like drawing quality with infinite canvas and zooming capabilities.

## Why Mischief? 
"Less is more.

I want to make something so simple to use that you don't have to think. You don't have to read a manual. You don't have to know anything about printing resolution or screen size or memory limits or who you are making your artwork for, or how big it is going to be, or where it is going when you start drawing. We want to make it possible to make those decisions after you have created your masterpiece.

Great tools for creating artwork should be accessible to everyone.  Great software should be invisible to the user.

Drawing with a computer can be as fun and as powerful as drawing with pencil and paper. Digital drawing doesn't require compromises.  You don't need to choose between pixels and vectors - there is a better way."

# Mischief Modified (Fake Portable)

Mischief Modified (Fake Portable) is a modification made by CheshireCat that changes the screen layout, font sizes, and colors in order to make the program more comfortable to use. I liked my changes a lot, so I decided to share it. You can find both a light and dark version in the downloads [here](https://github.com/Aram-Lin/Mischief-Draw-All-version/tree/main/Mischief%20Modified%20Version/History%E2%80%94Not%20Real%20Portable), or in the "Historyâ€”Not Real Portable" folder found in the "Mischief Modified Version" folder.


### Mischief Modified Version 1.1.2 (Dark)

# Real Portable
In addition to the above, I have also provided a "real" portable version using Turbo Studio and ThinApp making.
By default, Mischief will create files in registry/appdata/etc, even when using the official "portable" versions. This "real" version works by creating a single folder that will contain all appdata/registery items. Upon launch, the program will move these files where necessary - and after you shut down the program, they will be moved back.
I've also fixed the problem with version 1.12 not being able to use .art files. 

You can find download this version [here](https://github.com/Aram-Lin/Mischief-Draw-All-version/tree/main/Mischief%20Modified%20Version)
