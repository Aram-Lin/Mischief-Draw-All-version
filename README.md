# Mischief
Project to host the Mischief binaries and codes. Purpose is to reverse engineer the Mischief project for education purposes.



# Mischief-Draw-All-version
This is from a set of graphics software. Mischief has stopped development and the official website has stopped operating. I will share the version I find as best I can.

Note: Install versions 2.00 through 2.10 of THE FOUNDRY Mischief. An additional x86 with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 is required
